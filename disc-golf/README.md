## Overview
The purpose of this app is to record the score the user gets when playing the amazing game called "Disc Golf". Disc Golf works the same as regular Golf, but instead of using iron clubs to launch the ball, the player launches discs. Par can be set by the player, make sure to consult the Official [PDGA](#official-pdga-rules-of-disc-golf) Rules. Once the player finishes the game, there is a button "Submit" which will summarize how the player did throughout the game. The score can be saved as a PNG or posted on social media.
